# Sentiment Analysis using IMDB Movie Review Dataset

In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB large movie review dataset. The dataset contains a collection of positive and negative reviews on movies, aimed at building a model to classify these reviews as either positive or negative based on their sentiment.

## Dataset Description

The IMDB dataset is a popular resource for sentiment analysis tasks in natural language processing. It consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset provides both training and testing data. To access the dataset, you can download it from [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Refer to the README file accompanying the dataset for a comprehensive understanding of its structure and content.

## Data Preprocessing

Before creating the sentiment analysis model, we perform data preprocessing to prepare the textual data for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Preprocessing steps typically involve tokenization, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and transforming the text into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Network Design

We design a neural network for sentiment classification, aiming to distinguish positive from negative movie reviews. The architecture of the network includes layers for text embedding, recurrent layers (such as LSTM or GRU), fully connected layers, and an output layer for binary classification.

## Training and Testing

We utilize the provided training and testing datasets to train and evaluate our sentiment analysis network. The training process involves feeding the preprocessed textual data into the network, optimizing the model's parameters using an appropriate optimizer, and monitoring the training accuracy.

## Model Saving

The trained sentiment analysis model is saved as 'YOUR_ID_NLP_model' in the models directory. The model can be loaded later for evaluation on unseen data.

## Report

We provide a comprehensive report that covers the following aspects:
- **Data Preprocessing**: A detailed explanation of the preprocessing steps applied to the textual data.
- **Network Design Choices**: Insights into the architecture of the sentiment analysis network, including the choice of layers, activation functions, and any other relevant design decisions.
- **Training and Testing Accuracies**: Presentation of the accuracies achieved during training and testing phases.
- **Comments and Observations**: Any comments, observations, or reflections on the model's performance, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvements.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie review dataset. By preprocessing the text data and designing a neural network, we aim to effectively classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their sentiment, contributing to the field of natural language processing.
